	</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This format is to be used for submissions that are published in the conference extended abstracts.  We wish to give this volume a consistent, high-quality appearance. We therefore ask that authors follow some simple guidelines. In essence, you should format your paper exactly like this document. The easiest way to do this is simply to download a template from the conference website and replace the content with your own material.  The template file contains specially formatted styles (<b>e.g., Normal, Heading 1,</b> <tt> Bullet, Table Text,</tt> References, <b>title, authorName</b>) that will reduce your work in formatting your submission.

	</p>
	<h2>Copyright</h2>
	<p>	
		For publications in the CHI Extended Abstracts, copyright remains with the author.  The publication is not considered an archival publication; however, it does go into the ACM Digital Library. Because you retain copyright, as the author you are free to use this material as you like, including submitting a paper based on this work to other conferences or journals.  Authors grant unrestricted permission for ACM to publish the accepted submission in the CHI Extended Abstracts without additional consideration or remuneration.
	</p>
	<h2>Text formatting</h2>
	<p>	
		Please use an 8.5-point Verdana font, or other sans serifs font as close as possible in appearance to Verdana in which these guidelines have been set. (The “Normal” style for this document automatically gives you this font setting.) Arial 9-point font is a reasonable substitute for Verdana as it has a similar x-height. Please use serif or non-proportional fonts only for special purposes, such as distinguishing source code text.
	</p>
	<h3>Text styles</h3>
	<p>
		The template uses MS Word text styles to facilitate text formatting. The applicable text styles are:
	</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>normal – for body text</li>
		<li>heading 1, heading 2, heading 3</li>
		<li>bullet list</li>
		<li>numbered list</li>
		<li>caption</li>
		<li>annotation – for notes in the narrow left margin</li>
		<li>reference – for bibliographic entries</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Additionally, here is an example of footnoted text.  (the footnote is created with the “footnote…” command under the “Insert” menu in MS Word).  As stated in the footnote, footnotes should rarely be used.
	</p>	
	<h3>Language, style, and content</h3>

	<p>
		The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian, US, etc.) provided this is done consistently. Hyphenation is optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please pay attention to the following:
	</p>	
	<div class="footnote">			
		Use footnotes sparingly, if at all.
	</div>		
	<ul>
		<li>Write in a straightforward style. Use simple sentence structure. Try to avoid long sentences and complex sentence structures. Use semicolons carefully.</li>
		<li>Use common and basic vocabulary (e.g., use the word “unusual” rather than the word “arcane”).</li>
		<li>Briefly define or explain all technical terms. The terminology common to your practice/discipline may be different in other design practices/disciplines.</li>
		<li>Spell out all acronyms the first time they are used in your text. For example, “World Wide Web (WWW)”.</li>
		<li>Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city names in a particular country).</li>
		<li>Explain “insider” comments. Ensure that your whole audience understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g., do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular application).</li>
		<li>Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like “red herring” requires a cultural knowledge of English. Humor and irony are difficult to translate.</li>
		<li>Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as times, dates, currencies and numbers (e.g., “1-5-97” or “5/1/97” may mean 5 January or 1 May, and “seven o'clock” may mean 7:00 am or 19:00).</li>
		<li>Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (<i>he, she</i>) and other gender-specific words (<i>chairman, manpower, man-months</i>). Use inclusive language (e.g., <i>she or he, they, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years</i>) that is gender-neutral. If necessary, you may be able to use “he” and “she” in alternating sentences, so that the two genders occur equally often <cite>Sch1995</cite>. </li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Figures</h2>
	<p>
		The examples on this and following pages should help you get a feel for how screen-shots and other figures should be placed in the template. <i>Be sure to make images large enough so the important details are legible and clear.</i>
	</p>
	<p>	
		Your document may use color figures, which are included in the page limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black and white.
	</p>
	<p>	
		If you aren’t familiar with Word’s handling of pictures, we offer one tip: the “format picture” dialog is the key to controlling position of pictures and the flow of text around them. You access these controls by selecting your picture, then choosing “Picture…” from the “Format” menu. 
	</p>	
	<img src="./img/img_chi_extended_abstract/ChiExtended01.png" alt="Figure 01."/>
	<div class="figCaption">Insert a caption below each figure. Use the “caption” style to format the text.</div>
	<p>	
		The picture format dialog has five tabs, with three—size, position, and wrapping—probably being the most useful here. 
	</p>
	<p>	
		As for the “picture” tab in that dialog, we recommend using Photoshop or other graphics software to scale images, rather than scaling them after you have placed them in Word. Word’s scaling tends to reduce the clarity and legibility of images more so than dedicated graphics software. 
	</p>
	<img src="./img/img_chi_extended_abstract/ChiExtended02.png" alt="Figure 01."/>
	<div class="figCaption">If your figure has a light background, you can set its outline to light gray, like this, to make a box around it. The column width is 8.5 cm (3.34”), so setting this picture to fill the column was easily done by right-clicking on it (option-click on the Mac), choosing “format picture,” then the “size” tab, and setting its width to 8.5 cm (3.34”).</div>
	<p>		
		Page five shows a treatment of large figures, too big to fit inside a single column of text.			
	</p>
	<h2>References and Citations</h2>
	<p>
		Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets [2,4,5,7]. For papers from conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and an abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003 proceedings, use Proc. Interact 2003). Do not include the location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page numbers if available. See the examples of citations at the end of this document. Within this template file, use the References style for the text of your citation.
		Your references should be published materials accessible to the public.  Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a nominal fee.  Proprietary information may not be cited. Private communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced  (e.g., “[Robertson, personal communication]”).
	</p>
	<h2>Producing and testing PDF files</h2>
	<p>
		We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well before the final deadline.  Besides making sure that you are able to produce a PDF, you will need to check that (a) the length of the file remains within the submission category’s page limit, (b) the PDF file size is 4 megabytes or less, and (c) the file can be read and printed using Adobe Acrobat Reader. 
	</p>
	<p>		
		Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 7. This is widely available at no cost from <cite>Ado2009</cite>.  Note that most reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat reader, which cannot handle documents containing non-North American or non-European fonts (e.g. Asian fonts).  Please therefore do not use Asian fonts, and verify this by testing with a North American/European Acrobat reader (obtainable as above). Something as minor as including a space or punctuation character in a two-byte font can render a file unreadable.

	<div class="fullPageImg" id="fullPageImg">
		<div class ="leftMargin">
			<img src="./img/img_chi_extended_abstract/ChiExtended04.png" alt="Figure 01."/>
			<div class="figCaption">One good use of the narrow margin column: callouts that annotate a figure, either with text or a more detailed image.</div>
		</div>
		<div class ="rightMargin">
			<p>So long as you don’t type outside the right margin, it’s okay to put annotations over here on the right, too. Remember to use the annotation text style.</p>	
		</div>
		<div class ="center">
			<img src="./img/img_chi_extended_abstract/ChiExtended03.png" alt="Figure 01."/>
			<div class="figCaption">You can make figures as wide as you need, up to a maximum of the full width of both columns. To achieve this, select the figure and the caption, choose “columns” under the  “Format” menu, pick the “One” (single column) icon at the top of the dialog, and make sure you are making the change only for “selected text” (at the bottom of the dialog). This image was saved as a low-quality jpg to reduce the size of the this file. Your images should be higher quality, so readers can clearly see the details. </div>
